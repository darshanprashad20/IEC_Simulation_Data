**INTRODUCTION
IEC 104, also known as IEC 60870-5-104, is a communication protocol used in telecontrol, teleprotection, and other telecommunication functions within electrical power systems.
It is designed to facilitate the exchange of information between control centers and substation equipment over wide area networks using standard transport profiles.

Frame Structure: The protocol uses a variable-length frame structure, allowing it to handle a variety of data types and sizes.
This flexibility is beneficial for modern industrial applications that require complex data handling.

**Frame Structure

    1. Start Byte (0x68): The frame always begins with the start byte 0x68 to indicate the beginning of a frame.
    2. Length Field: The second byte specifies the length of the APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit), excluding the start byte and the length field itself.
    3. Control Field: This field contains control information used for communication management. It can include sequence numbers for sent and received frames, commands, and acknowledgments.
    4. ASDU (Application Service Data Unit): The ASDU contains the actual data being transmitted. It includes several sub-fields:
        ◦ Type Identifier: Specifies the type of information (e.g., single-point information, double-point information).
        ◦ Variable Structure Qualifier: Indicates the number of information objects and the presence of optional fields.
        ◦ Cause of Transmission: Specifies why the data is being transmitted (e.g., spontaneous, cyclic, request).
        ◦ Common Address of ASDU: Identifies the address of the device sending or receiving the data.
        ◦ Information Object Address: Specifies the address of the data within the device.
        ◦ Information Elements: Contains the actual data values (e.g., status, measurements).
    5. Checksum: Ensures data integrity by verifying that the frame has not been altered during transmission.
    6. End Byte (0x16): The frame ends with the byte 0x16, signaling the end of the frame.


**Example

Let's consider a simple example where the control center requests the status of a single point from a remote device.
Frame Breakdown:
    • Start Byte: 0x68
    • Length Field: 0x0E (14 bytes long, excluding the start byte and length field)
    • Control Field: Contains control information for managing the communication.
    • ASDU:
        ◦ Type Identifier: 0x01 (indicating single-point information)
        ◦ Variable Structure Qualifier: 0x01 (one information object)
        ◦ Cause of Transmission: 0x03 (request)
        ◦ Common Address of ASDU: 0x01 (address of the remote device)
        ◦ Information Object Address: 0x0100 (address of the specific data point)
        ◦ Information Elements: 0x01 (status of the single point: ON)
    • Checksum: Calculated value to verify data integrity
    • End Byte: 0x16

    • 03: Cause of Transmission (request)
    • 01: Common Address of ASDU (device address)
    • 00 01 00: Information Object Address (data point address)
    • 01: Information Elements (status: ON)
    • 00 00: Checksum (example values)
    • 16: End Byte

**Application Examples

    Integrate existing devices to a modern control system with a field proven product

    Use the IEC-104 event based communication instead of polling

    Feeder automation

    Substation automation

    Utility automation

    Reclosers

    Protection relays

1. IEC870 COT Cause
Purpose: Indicates the Cause of Transmission (COT), such as periodic updates, spontaneous reports, or interrogations. INTROGEN = 20 represents a general interrogation response.

2. SBO Timeout
Purpose: Sets the Select Before Operate (SBO) timeout value in seconds. This is relevant for certain control models where an action needs to be confirmed within a timeout period. A value of 0 means SBO is not used.
